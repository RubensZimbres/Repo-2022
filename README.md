<b>Cellular Automaton</b>  
In this Python file, I add a cellular automaton to a PyTorch kernel, add a residual layer to achieve 99.29% accuracy on test set in MNIST, results better than Robust Training in High Dimensions via Block Coordinate Geometric Median Descent", by Google AI and Amazon Search (2021).
  
<b>TF-Keras</b>  
This folder has the code to customize ResNet Architecture via dictionary config, changing first two layers to receive multispectral images with 9 channels. Final layers are also added, for training and inference.  
  
<b>Tensorflow Hub</b>  
This folder has the code to generate word embeddings using BERT multilingual model from Tensorflow Hub, in the format (2,768).  
  
<b>Wav2Vec2</b>  
Here you can find Python code to finetune Wav2Vec model of Speech Recognition, as well as the code for testing the model. The Large version of the model is at my Hugging Face repository - Rubens Zimbres:
